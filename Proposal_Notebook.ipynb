    "Overall, for the 'players' dataset, it appears to be clean but contains a few issues. The Age column has missing values that would need to be addressed. The name variable may not provide any analytical value beyond labeling. Hidden concerns include sampling bias, as the dataset may not represent the entire player population. The reliability of self-reported measures is also uncertain—if played_hours were not automatically logged, they could be inaccurate. Despite these limitations, the dataset offers a solid foundation for examining how experience, age, gender, and subscription status influence player engagement. Despite these issues, the datasets provide a strong foundation for exploring player engagement, frequency, and duration of play. When combined with players.csv, it can reveal how factors like experience level, age, or subscription status influence overall session behavior and time investment."

More specifically, we ask whether a player’s experience level, age, and total playtime can predict subscription status. To explore this, we used players.csv, focusing on subscribe as the response variable and experience, age, and played_hours as explanatory variables."

The Distribution of Player Experience plot shows that most players are Amateur or Regular, suggesting the platform attracts mid-level users. The Average Playtime by Subscription Status plot shows subscribers spend more time playing on average than non-subscribers, indicating engagement may be related to subscription. The Relationship Between Age and Playtime plot shows no strong correlation, suggesting age is not a major factor in playtime variation."

    "To address our question, we will apply a k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classification model. This method is suitable because subscribe is binary and k-NN classifies observations based on similarity across multiple predictors. It makes few assumptions about data distribution and can capture non-linear relationships. Categorical variables such as experience will be numerically encoded (e.g., values 0–4), and all numeric variables will be standardized so features on different scales contribute equally to distance calculations. While k-NN can be sensitive to irrelevant features and the choice of k, cross-validation on the training data will be used to select the optimal value. The dataset will be split into 70% training and 30% testing subsets, and performance will be assessed using accuracy and precision. This approach will enable a reliable exploration of how player traits relate to the likelihood of newsletter subscription."
